# Readme
Enumeration tool which can help you while doing CTF ( THM, HTB ).
Have you ever tried to local privilege escalation your way to the root, but nothing came up, Just a waste of time and bunch of searching? While Learning Bash, Python, Cyber Security, im also taking some 'Capture The Flag' challenges, which at the end of them, i have to make a privilege escalation, and gaining access no matter what, but you already know, right? Now, It is very frustrating to search for any ods/clues/missconfiguration/ while trying to performe privilege escalation, and there a bunch of  challenges with differents Techniques, as you already know ( refers to linux), so i decide to make a bash script, with some options to help me/you to see if anything can help you make a local privilege escalation while you are in, and search in the system for something that might help you to reach your goal (Who doesn't like flags?)

It's nothing new, just another way to make it easier for me/you, while we dont want to type so much commands, and find out nothing came out, which is a waste of time. One script, Bunch of options, just let it run and wait to see if your eyes cought something suspicious, which is good for us. Hope you will all find it useful while trying, and ofcourse - Have fun while learning!
